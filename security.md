# Security

## Description

Security might be concerned with controlling or restricting access to information or it might e concerned with protecting your systems from malicious actors. Often, security measures deal with both! Though it's always good to consider security when writing your applications, it will be especially important if you store or transmit user information and other sensitive data.

Possible security measures you might implement...

Covered in our curriculum:
  * implement user authentication, as seen in the `jwt-auth` challenge
  * use excellent [error-handling hygiene](https://owasp-top-10-proactive-controls-2018.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c10-handle-errors-exceptions.html)

Additional to our standard curriculum:
  * use [secure headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/)
  * [enforce TypeScript schemas](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction)
  * implement [user authorisation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html) for select content or functionality
  * implement [file upload security](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.html)
  * build purposeful [input validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)
  * other security measures of your choosing

### Tips

* Use different browsers or "incognito" windows to test your app as different users or in logged-in and logged-out states at the same time

## Learning objective(s)

2. Demonstrate an understanding of quality practices for software development, such as automated testing, performance, and security
