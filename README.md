We can be proud of anything we've built, whether or not it even works, but what does it mean for software to be built at a high level of quality? Opinions will vary widely between businesses, teams, and individual developers, especially with regards to what is the **most** important, but here we'll go into some detail on a few of the common answers to this question.

- [Performance](performance.md)
- [Security](security.md)
- [Accessibility](accessibility.md)
- [Code Quality](code-quality.md)
- [Testing](testing.md)

This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but they are some of the topics nearest to the tech we cover at Dev Academy, and most conveniently implemented in the course of your daily challenges. If there are other quality measures that you are particularly interested in or passionate about, you can discuss with your facilitator how to use those for your assessment, instead.

> Other software quality measures might include: Observability, Internationalisation, Localisation, Reliability, Cross-browser comapatability and many others.
