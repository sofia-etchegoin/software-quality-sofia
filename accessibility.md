# Accessibility

## Description

Digital accessibility is the idea that software should not include any barriers that prevent its use. While developers and designers don't usually intend to build barriers into their applications, it often happens by accident. Checking our apps for common accessibility obstacles can help ensure the software we put into the world can be used by anyone.

Possible accessibility measures you might implement...

Covered in our curriculum:
* complete browser-based testing with the WAVE tool for at least 2 pages of your app, including a page with a form, and resolve any detected issues
* complete manual testing of keyboard accessibility for at least 2 pages of your app, including a page with a form, and resolve any detected issues

Additional to our standard curriculum:
* write at least 3 passing [component tests for accessibility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest-axe)
* test with a screen reader, such as [VoiceOver for MacOS](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/voiceover) or [Narrator for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/accessibility/accessibility-testing#verify-main-app-scenarios-by-using-narrator) and write a few sentences describing what you learned from the process
* other accessibility measures of your choosing

### Tips

## Learning objective(s)

2. Demonstrate an understanding of quality practices for software development, such as automated testing, performance, and security

## Required
Choose and implement two [software quality measures](../software-quality/) to complete CP02.

## Requirements for fulfilling CP02

* I have selected and implemented any **two** accessibility measures, either from the list above or of my own choosing
* I have included a comment in my CP02 submission to tell the facilitator which accessibility measures I have selected and implemented **and which pages I've tested**, if applicable
* If I have chosen to test with a screenreader, I have included a few sentences describing what I learned from the process
* **Check:** My application runs and I have implemented at least two of the above accessibility measures, and I have included a comment on CP02 to explain which accessibility measures I have selected and implemented. If applicable, I have also included **which pages I've tested** and/or a few sentences about the experience of testing with a screenreader
* **Submit:** I have checked what I am submitting does the above, and I have posted a link to my branch or commit(s) that displays the criteria
